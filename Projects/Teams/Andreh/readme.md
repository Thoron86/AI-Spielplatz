# AI Voice Chat Agent on Raspberry Pi

A project exploring the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi by building an interactive voice chat agent. Users can speak to the bot via a microphone, and it responds audibly using a local AI model (Ollama with Gemma 3). A simple graphical user interface is included for a more interactive experience.

**Key Features:**

* Voice input using microphone.
* Integration with a local AI model (Gemma 3B via Ollama).
* Text-to-speech output.
* Basic graphical user interface with chat history.

**Note:** Speech recognition currently relies on an internet connection.
